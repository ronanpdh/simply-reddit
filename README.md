# Simply Reddit

**What?** 
A simple Reddit client to get an overview of the top posts from various topics without any auth flow or things to slow you down.

**Why?** 
We all love reddit but boy is it easy to get lost in, doom scrolling seems like a feature... Sometimes it's great to be able to dip into reddit, read some posts without getting too caught up and dip out again. You get to keep up with the never ending trends and stories without the attention stealing!

## Features
**Currently you can:**
- Select topics from predefined categories
- Search for topics based on user input
- Dark and Light Mode
- Navigate to the post on reddit
- See upvotes, who posted and how many comments each page has]
- Fully Responsive

**Coming Soon**
  - [] View post details and comments rather than navigating off Simply Reddit
  - [] Comment on posts from the app
  - [] Create Dashboards for accessings favoruite topics quickly

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
